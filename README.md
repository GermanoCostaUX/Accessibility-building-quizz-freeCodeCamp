#(New) Responsive Web Design

In this Responsive Web Design Project, I learned the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

Accessibility is making your webpage easy for all people to use â€“ even people with disabilities.

In this code, I built a quiz webpage. I learned accessibility tools such as keyboard shortcuts, ARIA attributes, and design best practices.
